## Blackjack Project

#### Skill Distillery Week 4 Homework

### Overview

You are going to play BlackJack against the computer (Dealer). The objective is to get to 21 points without going over.  You can choose to hit (dealer deals another card) or stay.
Follow instructions through game for operation.

### How To Play

The dealer deals two cards to the player and herself. You will see the two cards you were dealt and one faceup card the dealer dealt herself.  Your objective is to get as close as you can to 21 points without going over and to beat the Dealer by being the closest to 21 points. Add up the numerical value of cards: face cards (King, Queen and Jack) are worth 10 points, Ace is worth 11. All other cards are face value. 

If you want another press 1 (Hit), if you are satisfied with your current hand press 2 (Stay). 

After the Dealer shows her hand and has under 17 point she will automatically hit until Dealer's hand is above 17, gets a Blackjack (21 points) or went over 21 and lost the game. 

If your cards value is 21, you win; if your total is higher than Dealer's hand, without going over 21; you win.  If the Dealer's hand is 21 or higher than your hand, you loose.  A tie is an automatic Player win.

Have fun playing!
